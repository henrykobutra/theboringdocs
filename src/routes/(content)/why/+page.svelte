	<h1>Why You Need These Pages on Your Website</h1>

	<p>
		Hey there little one! Have you ever wondered why some websites have pages like "Terms and
		Conditions" or "Privacy Policy"? Well, wonder no more! We're here to explain it to you like
		you're 5.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, you might be wondering why we're even talking about this. The truth is, we were
		experimenting with some cool new tools called SvelteKit and Vercel, and we wanted to create a
		fun little website to show them off. And what better way to do that than by explaining why these
		pages are important?
	</p>

	<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
	<p>
		These are like the rules of the website. They tell you what you can and can't do, and what the
		website owner can and can't do. It's like playing a game - you need to know the rules to play
		fair.
	</p>

	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>
		This is all about keeping your secrets safe. It tells you what the website owner can and can't
		do with your personal information, like your name, email, or phone number. It's like a secret
		club - you want to make sure your secrets are safe.
	</p>

	<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
	<p>
		These are like the crumbs from your cookies. They're little bits of information that websites
		collect about you, like what pages you visit or what you buy. It's like a little helper that
		remembers what you like and what you don't.
	</p>

	<h2>Payment and Refunds Policy</h2>
	<p>
		This is like a receipt for your shopping. It tells you how much you paid, what you bought, and
		what you can do if you want to return something. It's like a guarantee that you'll be happy with
		your purchase.
	</p>

	<h2>FAQs</h2>
	<p>
		These are like asking your mom a million questions. They're all the common questions people
		might have about the website or what they can do on it. It's like having a personal assistant to
		answer all your questions.
